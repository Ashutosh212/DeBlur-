# Image Deblurring using Kernel Filters

This project aims to deblur images generated from kernel filters using deep learning techniques. The goal is to improve the visual quality of blurred images and enhance their clarity.

## Overview

Blurring in images can occur due to various reasons such as motion blur, out-of-focus blur, or intentional application of blurring filters. Image deblurring involves the process of recovering the original sharp image from its blurred version.

In this project, we focus on deblurring images that have been generated from kernel filters. We use deep learning models, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to learn the mapping between the blurred and sharp images.

## PSNR Score

Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) is a commonly used metric to evaluate the quality of reconstructed images. A higher PSNR value indicates better image quality. In this project, we achieved a PSNR score of 19, indicating significant improvement in image quality after deblurring.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/image-deblurring.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Prepare your dataset of blurred and sharp images.
4. Train the deep learning model using the provided scripts.
5. Evaluate the model performance using PSNR and other metrics.

## Results

The deblurring model demonstrates impressive performance in enhancing the visual quality of blurred images. Here are some examples of the deblurred images produced by the model:
